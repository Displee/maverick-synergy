# Maverick Synergy Java SSH API
The Maverick Synergy project is the third generation Java SSH API developed by JADAPTIVE Limited (previously known as SSHTOOLS Limited). Released under a commercial friendly open source license (LGPL), this new API builds upon the successes of the original J2SSH open source and the J2SSH Maverick commercial APIs by combining a current and up-to-date, fully maintained, open source API with full time developer backing and commercial support & resolution options.

Built upon the Java NIO framework the API for the first time provides a unified framework for developing both client and server solutions.

The core API has no third-party dependencies other than a Java Runtime with Java Cryptography Extensions.
